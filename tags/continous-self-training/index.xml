      <description>Each time I attempt to see intelligence in machine learning models, there would be a doubt rising in my head - how could intelligence, characterized by high-level abstraction capability, be acquired simply by a gradient descent process reaching convergence? I would rather believe that the journey of pursuing intelligence is a back-and-forth, twist-and-turns, and chaotic-and-conscious process with loops, eventually jumping out of loops and reaching some enlightment point. Therefore, it cannot be achieved only with one single objective formulated by one specific optimizatoin problem.</description>
