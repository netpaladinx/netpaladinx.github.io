      <description>There are two major theories of the brain&amp;rsquo;s cognitive function - the theory of modularity and the theory of distributive processing. Instead of asking whether brain&amp;rsquo;s regions are functionally interconnected or specialized, I tend to think of them as complementary to each other.
For the modularity theory, specialized regions are domain specific for different cognitive processes. From the evolutionary perspective, human mind evolved with enhanced functionality developing as a result of its increasing fitting capability to gain more adaptiveness, such as prefrontal cortex that handles high-level cognitive processes, and visual area V4 and V5 in charge of the perception of color and vision motion.</description>
